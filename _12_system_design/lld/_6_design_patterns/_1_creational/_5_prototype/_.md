## Prototype Design Pattern
1. What is the Prototype Design Pattern?

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create new objects by copying (cloning) an existing object. Instead of creating an object from scratch, you use a prototype as a template and make copies of it.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine you’re a teacher handing out a worksheet to your students. Instead of writing the same worksheet 30 times, you prepare one master copy and photocopy it for all the students. If a student needs a slightly different version, you can make a copy and edit it as needed.

In programming, the "master copy" is the prototype object, and "photocopying" is the cloning process.
3. Why Use the Prototype Design Pattern?

    Efficient Object Creation: When creating an object is expensive (e.g., involves lots of processing or fetching data), cloning a prototype is faster and more efficient.
    Simplifies Object Creation: Allows you to avoid repetitive initialization code.
    Customization: You can start with a copy of an existing object and make slight modifications without affecting the original.

4. Analogy Example: Photocopying a Resume

Imagine you’re applying for multiple jobs, and each job requires a slightly different resume. Instead of creating a new resume from scratch for every job, you start with your master resume and make small changes, like updating the objective statement or adding a skill.

5. Real Project Example: Creating Game Characters

In a video game, characters often share many properties like health, speed, and abilities. Instead of creating every character from scratch, you can define a prototype for each type of character and clone it to create new instances.
