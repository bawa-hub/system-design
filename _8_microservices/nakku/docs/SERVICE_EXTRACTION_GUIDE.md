# 🚀 Service Extraction Guide

## Overview

Your Nakku Quick-Commerce app is now **perfectly structured** for easy service extraction! Each service has its own `go.mod` file and can be deployed independently.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### **Service-Level Modules Structure**
```

│   ├── go.mod                    # API Gateway module
│   ├── go.sum
│   ├── config/                   # Service-specific config
│   ├── database/                 # Service-specific database

├── services/

│   ├── product/
│   │   ├── go.mod               # Product service module
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ... (other services)
└── shared/                      # Only for truly shared utilities
    └── go.mod                   # Shared library module
```

## ✅ Benefits of This Structure

### **1. Zero-Effort Extraction**
- Each service is **completely independent**
- No shared dependencies between services
- Can be copied to a new repository instantly

### **2. Independent Deployment**
- Each service can be deployed separately
- Different teams can work on different services
- Independent scaling and versioning

### **3. Technology Flexibility**
- Each service can use different Go versions
- Different dependency versions per service
- Technology stack independence

### **4. Development Efficiency**
- Services can be developed and tested independently
- Faster builds (only build what you need)
- Clear service boundaries

## 🔧 How to Extract a Service

### **Step 1: Copy Service Directory**
```bash
# Extract User Service
cp -r services/user /path/to/new-repo/
cd /path/to/new-repo/
```

### **Step 2: Update Module Name (Optional)**
```bash
# If you want to change the module name
cd user
go mod edit -module github.com/your-org/user-service
go mod tidy
```

### **Step 3: Build and Deploy**
```bash
# Build the service
go build -o user-service .

# Create Docker image
docker build -t your-org/user-service .

# Deploy to your infrastructure
docker run -p 8081:8081 your-org/user-service
```

## 🚀 Service Dependencies

### **User Service Dependencies**
```go
// services/user/go.mod
module nakku/services/user

require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.10.1
    github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5 v5.3.0
    github.com/segmentio/kafka-go v0.4.49
    github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3
    github.com/spf13/viper v1.20.1
    golang.org/x/crypto v0.41.0
    gorm.io/driver/mysql v1.6.0
    gorm.io/gorm v1.30.2
)
```

### **API Gateway Dependencies**
```go
// api-gateway/go.mod
module nakku/api-gateway

require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.10.1
    github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5 v5.3.0
    github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3
    github.com/spf13/viper v1.20.1
)
```

## 🧪 Testing Service Independence

### **Test User Service**
```bash
cd services/user
go build -o user-service .
./user-service
```

### **Test API Gateway**
```bash
cd api-gateway
go build -o api-gateway .
./api-gateway
```

## 📋 Migration Checklist

When extracting a service:

- [ ] Copy service directory
- [ ] Update module name in go.mod
- [ ] Update import paths if needed
- [ ] Update Dockerfile if needed
- [ ] Update configuration files
- [ ] Update deployment scripts
- [ ] Test service builds independently
- [ ] Test service runs independently
- [ ] Update documentation

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Service Boundaries**
- Each service should have clear responsibilities
- Minimize inter-service communication
- Use events for loose coupling

### **2. Configuration Management**
- Each service has its own config
- Use environment variables for deployment
- Keep sensitive data in secrets

### **3. Database Strategy**
- Each service has its own database
- No direct database access between services
- Use events for data consistency

### **4. Communication**
- Use HTTP for synchronous communication
- Use Kafka for asynchronous communication
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience

## 🔄 Evolution Path

### **Phase 1: Monolithic Deployment (Current)**
- All services in one repository
- Single server deployment
- Shared infrastructure

### **Phase 2: Service Extraction (When Needed)**
- Extract high-traffic services first
- Deploy to separate servers
- Independent scaling

### **Phase 3: Full Microservices**
- Each service in separate repository
- Independent teams
- Full DevOps automation

## 🎉 Conclusion

Your architecture is **perfectly designed** for easy service extraction! The service-level `go.mod` files ensure that:

1. **No refactoring needed** when extracting services
2. **Zero dependency conflicts** between services
3. **Independent development** and deployment
4. **Future-proof architecture** that scales with your business

You can now confidently develop your services knowing that extraction will be **trivial** when you need it!
