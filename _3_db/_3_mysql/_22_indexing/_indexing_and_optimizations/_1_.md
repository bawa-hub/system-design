# What is an Index in MySQL?
An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional storage and slower write operations.
Instead of scanning the entire table, MySQL uses indexes to locate data efficiently.
Think of it like an index in a book: instead of scanning every page to find a term, you quickly refer to the index and go to the right page.

# Types of Indexes in MySQL

Primary Key Index (Clustered Index)
    
    Automatically created when a PRIMARY KEY is defined.
    The actual table data is stored in the order of this index.
    Only one clustered index per table.

Unique Index
    
    Ensures that all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.
    Does not allow duplicates but allows NULL values.
    Example:
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON users(email);

Regular (Non-Clustered) (B-Tree) Index

    Default index type in MySQL.
    Speeds up queries but allows duplicate values.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees(last_name);

Composite Index

    An index on multiple columns.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(first_name, last_name);

    Best used when filtering queries involve multiple columns in order.

Full-Text Index (For searching text efficiently)

    Used for full-text search queries.
    Supports Natural Language and Boolean Mode.
    Example:
    CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_text_search ON articles(content);

Spatial Index (R-Tree Index) (GIS Indexing)

    Used for geographical and spatial data types.
    Works with POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON, etc.
    Only supported with InnoDB and MyISAM.
    Example:
    CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_location ON geodata(location);

Covering Index

    An index that contains all the columns needed for a query, reducing the need to access table rows.

Partial Index (Generated via WHERE Clause)

    Indexes only a subset of rows based on conditions (MySQL 8+).
    Example: CREATE INDEX idx_active ON users(status) WHERE status = 'active';
        
Hash Index

    Used in MEMORY storage engine for fast lookups.
    Not useful for range queries.
