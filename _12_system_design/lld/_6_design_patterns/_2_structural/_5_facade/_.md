## Facade Design Pattern
1. What is the Facade Design Pattern?

The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system by exposing a single, easy-to-use interface, making it more user-friendly.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a universal remote control for your home theater system.

    Without a universal remote, you might have to deal with separate remotes for your TV, sound system, DVD player, and streaming device.
    The universal remote acts as a facade, offering a single, simple interface to control all these devices, so you don’t need to interact with each device separately.

3. Why Use the Facade Design Pattern?

    Simplifies Client Code: Clients don’t need to understand or interact with the complex subsystems.
    Improves Readability: Reduces the number of objects the client deals with.
    Decouples Subsystems: Changes in the underlying subsystems don’t directly affect the client.
    Promotes Reusability: The facade can be reused by multiple clients needing the same functionality.

4. Analogy Example: Travel Booking System

If you want to plan a trip:

    Without a facade: You’d need to separately book flights, hotels, and cars using different services.
    With a facade: A travel agency (or website) provides a simplified interface to book all these at once.

5. Real Project Example: Home Theater System

In a home theater system, you might have:

    A DVD player
    A projector
    A sound system

Without a facade, the client must control each device separately. With a facade, you can encapsulate the entire setup process into a single interface like watchMovie() or stopMovie().
