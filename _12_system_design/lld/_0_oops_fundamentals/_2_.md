# What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines:

    Data (fields/attributes)
    Behavior (methods/functions)

But it doesn't occupy memory until an object is created.

# What is an Object?

An object is a real-world instance of a class. It:

    Has a state (values of variables)
    Has behavior (defined by methods)
