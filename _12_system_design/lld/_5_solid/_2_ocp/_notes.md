O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

    Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

What does that mean?

    You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without changing its source code. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs when requirements change.

Real-World Analogy:

    Think of a power socket.
    You can plug in different appliances — fan, charger, laptop — without changing the socket itself.
    You extend its use without modifying it.
