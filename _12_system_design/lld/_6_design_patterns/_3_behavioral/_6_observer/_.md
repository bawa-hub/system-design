## Observer Design Pattern

1. What is the Observer Design Pattern?

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any changes to its state, typically by calling their update methods.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine you subscribe to a YouTube channel. Whenever the channel uploads a new video, you (the subscriber) get a notification.

    The YouTube channel is the subject.
    You are the observer.
    The notification is how the subject informs its observers of changes (new uploads).

3. Why Use the Observer Design Pattern?

    Automatic Updates: Observers are automatically notified of changes in the subject.
    Decoupling: The subject doesnâ€™t need to know details about the observers, reducing dependencies.
    Flexibility: You can add or remove observers dynamically at runtime.

4. Analogy Example: Newspaper Subscription

When you subscribe to a newspaper:

    The newspaper company is the subject.
    The subscribers (people receiving the newspaper) are the observers.
    Whenever a new edition is published, the company delivers it to all subscribers.

5. Real Project Example: Stock Price Monitoring

Imagine a stock market application where multiple clients (e.g., traders, investors) want to track the price of a stock. When the stock price changes, all interested clients are notified automatically.
