# 📚 LESSON 2: DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN & SERVICE DESIGN

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is and why it matters for microservices
- How to identify bounded contexts and service boundaries
- Core DDD concepts: Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events
- How to design services using DDD principles
- How to model complex domains effectively
- How to implement DDD patterns in Go
