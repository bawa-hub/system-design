## Composite Design Pattern
1. What is the Composite Design Pattern?

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a file system on your computer.

    A file is an individual item.
    A folder can contain files or other folders.

You can perform operations like "open," "delete," or "move" on both files and folders, treating them uniformly. A folder will delegate the operation to its contents, which could be other folders or files. This way, you can handle files and folders the same way, regardless of whether they are single objects or collections.
3. Why Use the Composite Design Pattern?

    Simplifies Client Code: Treat individual objects and collections uniformly.
    Tree-Like Structures: Perfect for scenarios with part-whole hierarchies (e.g., file systems, organization charts).
    Open/Closed Principle: Easily extend with new components without altering existing code.

4. Analogy Example: Organization Hierarchy

In a company:

    An Employee can be an individual worker.
    A Department can be a group of employees or other departments.

Both Employees and Departments can share common operations, like calculating salaries or displaying details, even though a department will recursively aggregate its employees' salaries or details.
5. Real Project Example: Graphics Editor

In a graphics editor, you might have shapes like:

    Circle
    Rectangle
    Group (a collection of shapes)

The Group can contain individual shapes or other groups. Operations like "render" or "move" can be applied to both individual shapes and groups, treating them uniformly.
