## Builder Design Pattern
1. What is the Builder Design Pattern?

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you create complex objects step by step. 
Instead of forcing you to create an object in one go, it allows you to build the object piece by piece, giving you more control over the construction process.

2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine you are building a custom burger at a fast-food restaurant. You could just order a "standard burger," but if you want something unique (e.g., add extra cheese, remove onions, add bacon), you need a step-by-step process to customize it exactly how you want.

The Builder Pattern does something similar in programming. It breaks down the construction of complex objects into smaller, manageable steps.

3. Why Use the Builder Design Pattern?

    Manage Complex Object Construction: When an object has many optional fields or configurations, it becomes hard to use a long constructor with multiple parameters (called a "telescoping constructor"). The Builder Pattern makes this process easier and more readable.
    Improves Code Clarity: You can see each step of the object creation process clearly.
    Ensures Immutability: Often used to create immutable objects by assembling them step-by-step.
    Flexible Construction: You can create different representations of an object using the same construction process.

4. Analogy Example: Building a Custom Burger

When ordering a burger, you specify the ingredients step by step:

    Choose the bun (e.g., sesame, whole grain).
    Add the patty (e.g., beef, chicken, veggie).
    Select toppings (e.g., lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon).
    Choose the sauce (e.g., mayo, mustard, ketchup).

At the end, the cashier asks, "Are you done?" and then assembles the burger for you.

In code, the "Burger Builder" handles each step of the process, and the "Burger" is the final product.

5. Real Project Example: Building a Complex HTTP Request

Imagine you are creating an HTTP request in an application. An HTTP request can have many optional parts, such as headers, query parameters, body, and authentication.
