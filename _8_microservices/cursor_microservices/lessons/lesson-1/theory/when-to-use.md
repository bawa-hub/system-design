## üîç Detailed Decision Framework

### 1. Team Organization
**Conway's Law**: "Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure."

**Questions to Ask**:
- How many teams do you have?
- Can teams work independently?
- Do you have microservices expertise?
- How do teams communicate?

**Decision Tree**:
```
Team Size < 10?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Monolith (unless other factors override)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue to next factor

Teams can work independently?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Monolith (or improve team structure)
```

### 2. Application Characteristics
**Questions to Ask**:
- How complex is your domain?
- Are there clear service boundaries?
- Do different parts have different requirements?
- How often do you deploy?

**Decision Tree**:
```
Clear service boundaries?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Monolith (or refactor domain)

Different scaling requirements?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Consider monolith

High deployment frequency?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Monolith
```

### 3. Data Characteristics
**Questions to Ask**:
- Do services need different data models?
- Is data strongly related?
- Do you need ACID transactions?
- Can you handle eventual consistency?

**Decision Tree**:
```
Data strongly related?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Monolith (or careful service design)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Microservices

Need ACID transactions?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Monolith (or complex saga patterns)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Microservices

Different data requirements?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Monolith
```

### 4. Operational Requirements
**Questions to Ask**:
- Do you have DevOps expertise?
- Can you handle operational complexity?
- Do you need high availability?
- How important is performance?

**Decision Tree**:
```
DevOps expertise available?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Monolith (or hire DevOps)

High availability critical?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Microservices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Consider monolith

Performance critical?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Consider monolith (network latency)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No ‚Üí Microservices
```

## üìä Scoring System

### Rate Each Factor (1-5 scale)

#### Team Factors
- **Team Size**: 1 (small) to 5 (large)
- **Microservices Expertise**: 1 (none) to 5 (expert)
- **Team Independence**: 1 (tightly coupled) to 5 (independent)

#### Application Factors
- **Complexity**: 1 (simple) to 5 (complex)
- **Service Boundaries**: 1 (unclear) to 5 (clear)
- **Deployment Frequency**: 1 (rare) to 5 (continuous)

#### Data Factors
- **Data Coupling**: 1 (tightly coupled) to 5 (loosely coupled)
- **Transaction Requirements**: 1 (ACID critical) to 5 (eventual consistency OK)
- **Data Diversity**: 1 (single model) to 5 (diverse models)

#### Operational Factors
- **DevOps Maturity**: 1 (basic) to 5 (advanced)
- **Monitoring Capability**: 1 (basic) to 5 (comprehensive)
- **Availability Requirements**: 1 (standard) to 5 (critical)

### Calculate Scores
```
Microservices Score = (Team Size + Expertise + Independence + 
                      Complexity + Boundaries + Deployment + 
                      Data Coupling + Transaction + Data Diversity + 
                      DevOps + Monitoring + Availability) / 12

If Score >= 3.5: Choose Microservices
If Score < 3.5: Choose Monolith
```

## üéØ Common Scenarios
