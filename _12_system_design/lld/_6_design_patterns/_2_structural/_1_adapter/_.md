## Adapter Design Pattern

1. What is the Adapter Design Pattern?

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge, translating one interface into another so that classes can interact seamlessly.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine you have a laptop with a USB port and a phone with a USB-C port. You want to connect them, but the interfaces don’t match. An adapter (like a USB-to-USB-C adapter) solves this problem by allowing the two devices to communicate even though their connectors are different.

In programming, the Adapter Pattern works similarly—it enables classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate by providing a translation layer.
3. Why Use the Adapter Design Pattern?

    Compatibility: To enable classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
    Reuse: Allows you to use an existing class without modifying its source code.
    Flexibility: Makes systems more flexible by decoupling classes from specific interfaces.

4. Analogy Example: Power Plug Adapter

If you travel to a country with a different type of power outlet, you use a power plug adapter to connect your devices. The adapter converts the plug type to match the outlet, allowing your device to work without any modification.
5. Real Project Example: Integrating Third-Party Libraries

Suppose you're building an application that uses a third-party payment library. However, your system’s interface for processing payments doesn’t match the library’s interface. You can use an Adapter to make them work together.
