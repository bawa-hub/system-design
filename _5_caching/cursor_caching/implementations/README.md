## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Navigate to the week/day you're studying**
2. **Run the Go files** to see concepts in action
3. **Modify the code** to experiment and learn
4. **Test different scenarios** to deepen understanding

## 📝 Running Examples

```bash
# Navigate to a specific implementation
cd implementations/week1/day1

# Run the implementation
go run main.go

# Run with specific examples
go run main.go -example=basic
go run main.go -example=advanced
```

## 🎯 Learning Approach

1. **Read the lesson** from the lessons directory
2. **Run the implementation** to see it in action
3. **Modify the code** to experiment
4. **Test edge cases** and different scenarios
5. **Move to the next concept** when comfortable
