    Polymorphism (Compile-time and Runtime) ✅

# Class and Object Deep Dive

    Creating and using classes/objects
    Constructors and types (default, parameterized, copy)
    Static vs non-static members
    this keyword
    Method overloading
    Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
    Initialization blocks
    Final keyword (variables, methods, classes)

3. Inheritance in Detail

    Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical Inheritance
    Method overriding
    super keyword
    Constructor chaining in inheritance
    Object slicing (in languages like C++)
    Diamond problem & Interfaces (multiple inheritance)

4. Polymorphism in Depth

    Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
    Runtime polymorphism (Method overriding)
    Dynamic method dispatch
    Type casting (Upcasting and Downcasting)
    Covariant return types

5. Abstraction and Encapsulation

    Abstract classes and methods
    Interfaces vs Abstract classes
    Achieving 100% abstraction
    Encapsulation: private fields + public getters/setters
    Data hiding

6. Special Classes and Relationships

    Nested and inner classes (Static, non-static, local, anonymous)
    Anonymous classes
    Composition vs Aggregation
    Association and Dependency

7. Object Class and Core Methods

    toString()
    equals() and hashCode()
    clone()
    finalize()
    getClass()

8. OOP Principles (SOLID)

    S: Single Responsibility Principle
    O: Open/Closed Principle
    L: Liskov Substitution Principle
    I: Interface Segregation Principle
    D: Dependency Inversion Principle

9. Advanced OOP Concepts

    Coupling and Cohesion
    Object mutability and immutability
    Class loading and reflection
    Design by contract
    Law of Demeter
    Composition over inheritance
    Marker interfaces
    Object cloning (shallow vs deep copy)
    Builder Pattern (for complex object creation)

10. Design Patterns (OOP Focused)

    Creational Patterns:

        Singleton
        Factory
        Abstract Factory
        Builder
        Prototype

    Structural Patterns:

        Adapter
        Composite
        Proxy
        Flyweight
        Decorator
        Bridge
        Facade

    Behavioral Patterns:

        Strategy
        Observer
        Command
        Template Method
        State
        Chain of Responsibility
        Mediator
        Visitor
        Memento

11. Best Practices in OOP

    Code Reusability
    Favor composition over inheritance
    Encapsulate what varies
    Avoiding god classes
    Use interfaces for flexibility
    Avoid tight coupling

12. Real-World Modeling & Applications

    Domain modeling with OOP
    UML Class Diagrams
    Object collaboration
    Modeling entities in real-world applications (e.g., E-commerce, Banking)
    Service-oriented OOP

13. OOP in Java-Specific Topics

    Java Memory Model (JMM) and Objects
    Garbage Collection and object lifecycle
    JavaBeans and POJOs
    Lombok annotations and boilerplate removal
    Serialization/Deserialization of objects
    Record classes (Java 14+)

✅ 14. Exception Handling and OOP

    Exception hierarchy (Throwable, Exception, RuntimeException, etc.)
    Custom exceptions and best practices
    Checked vs unchecked exceptions (how it fits OOP design)
    Exception handling with polymorphism
    Exception chaining

✅ 15. OOP in Multithreading Context

    Thread safety and object-level synchronization
    synchronized methods and blocks on objects
    volatile fields and their impact on encapsulation
    ThreadLocal objects for per-thread state
    Immutable objects in concurrent design (defensive copying, final fields)

✅ 16. Principles Related to Clean OOP Design

    Tell, Don’t Ask principle
    Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
    You Ain’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
    Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
    Avoid premature optimization

✅ 17. Functional OOP in Java (Post Java 8)

    Functional interfaces (Predicate, Function, etc.)
    Lambda expressions and method references in object behavior
    Using Streams API with OOP entities
    Optional as a wrapper object
    Immutability + lambdas = side-effect-free design

✅ 18. Object-Oriented Testing Practices

    Unit testing principles with objects (JUnit, Mockito)
    Mocking dependencies in OOP
    Testing polymorphic behavior
    Interface-driven testing

✅ 19. Serialization Pitfalls and Versioning

    serialVersionUID and compatibility
    Transient fields and encapsulation
    Object graphs in serialization (cyclic references, composition)
    Alternatives: JSON/XML serialization (e.g., Jackson, Gson)

✅ 20. Fluent Interfaces & Method Chaining

    Builder pattern in practice (e.g., StringBuilder)
    Designing fluent APIs (return this pattern)
    Immutability + chaining
