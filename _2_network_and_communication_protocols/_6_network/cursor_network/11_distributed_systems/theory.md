# Topic 11: Distributed Systems Networking - Distributed Architecture Mastery

## Distributed Systems Overview

Distributed systems are collections of independent computers that appear to users as a single coherent system. They are connected by a network and coordinate their actions by passing messages to achieve a common goal.

### Key Characteristics
- **Concurrency**: Multiple processes execute simultaneously
- **No Global Clock**: Processes don't share a common clock
- **Independent Failures**: Components can fail independently
- **Heterogeneity**: Different hardware, software, and networks
- **Scalability**: System can grow to handle increased load
- **Transparency**: System appears as a single entity to users

### Distributed System Challenges
- **Network Partitions**: Network splits can isolate components
- **Partial Failures**: Some components fail while others continue
- **Consistency**: Maintaining data consistency across nodes
- **Availability**: Ensuring system remains available during failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: Operating despite network partitions
- **Clock Synchronization**: Coordinating time across nodes

## CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot simultaneously provide all three guarantees:

### Consistency (C)
- All nodes see the same data at the same time
- After an update, all subsequent reads return the updated value
- Strong consistency vs. eventual consistency

### Availability (A)
- System remains operational and responsive
- Every request receives a response (success or failure)
- No downtime due to component failures

### Partition Tolerance (P)
- System continues operating despite network partitions
- Network splits don't cause system failure
- Messages can be lost or delayed

### CAP Trade-offs
- **CP Systems**: Consistency + Partition Tolerance (e.g., MongoDB, HBase)
- **AP Systems**: Availability + Partition Tolerance (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- **CA Systems**: Consistency + Availability (e.g., traditional RDBMS)

## Distributed System Architectures

### Client-Server Architecture
- **Client**: Requests services from servers
- **Server**: Provides services to clients
- **Communication**: Request-response pattern
- **Examples**: Web applications, database systems

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
- **Nodes**: Equal participants in the system
- **Communication**: Direct node-to-node communication
- **Examples**: BitTorrent, blockchain networks, distributed file systems

### Microservices Architecture
- **Services**: Small, independent, loosely coupled services
- **Communication**: HTTP, gRPC, message queues
- **Deployment**: Independent deployment and scaling
- **Examples**: Netflix, Uber, Amazon

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- **Services**: Business functionality exposed as services
- **Communication**: Web services, message queues
- **Integration**: Enterprise service bus (ESB)
- **Examples**: Enterprise systems, legacy integration

## Consensus Algorithms

Consensus algorithms ensure that all nodes in a distributed system agree on a single value or decision.

### Raft Algorithm
Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be understandable and implementable.

#### Raft States
- **Leader**: Handles client requests and log replication
- **Follower**: Receives log entries from leader
- **Candidate**: Attempts to become leader during election

#### Raft Process
1. **Election**: Nodes elect a leader when no leader exists
2. **Log Replication**: Leader replicates log entries to followers
3. **Safety**: Ensures consistency and availability
4. **Split Brain Prevention**: Prevents multiple leaders

#### Raft Benefits
- **Understandable**: Easier to understand than Paxos
- **Implementable**: Clear implementation guidelines
- **Fault Tolerant**: Handles node failures gracefully
- **Consistent**: Maintains strong consistency

### Paxos Algorithm
Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors.

#### Paxos Phases
1. **Prepare Phase**: Proposer sends prepare request
2. **Promise Phase**: Acceptors respond with promises
3. **Accept Phase**: Proposer sends accept request
4. **Learn Phase**: Acceptors learn the chosen value

#### Paxos Variants
- **Basic Paxos**: Single value consensus
- **Multi-Paxos**: Multiple value consensus
- **Fast Paxos**: Optimized for fast decisions
- **Byzantine Paxos**: Handles Byzantine failures

### PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
PBFT handles Byzantine failures where nodes can behave arbitrarily.

#### PBFT Process
1. **Request**: Client sends request to primary
2. **Pre-prepare**: Primary broadcasts pre-prepare message
3. **Prepare**: Replicas broadcast prepare messages
4. **Commit**: Replicas broadcast commit messages
5. **Reply**: Replicas send reply to client

#### PBFT Properties
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerant**: Handles up to (n-1)/3 Byzantine failures
- **Safety**: Ensures consistency despite failures
- **Liveness**: Ensures progress despite failures
- **Performance**: O(nÂ²) message complexity
