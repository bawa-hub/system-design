## Visitor Design Pattern

1. What is the Visitor Design Pattern?

The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations to a group of objects without modifying their structure. Instead of implementing the operation directly in the objects, you create a separate object (visitor) that defines the operation.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a zoo where different animals have unique ways of being fed, cleaned, or observed. Instead of making each animal handle these operations, you have a zookeeper (visitor) who knows how to perform these tasks for every animal.

The zookeeper (visitor) visits each animal (element) and performs the specific operation.
3. Why Use the Visitor Design Pattern?

    Open/Closed Principle: Add new operations without modifying existing classes.
    Separation of Concerns: Keeps the logic of operations separate from the object structure.
    Flexibility: Easily add new behaviors by creating new visitor classes.

4. Analogy Example: Car Service

In a car service center, different cars (like sedans, SUVs, or trucks) need unique servicing tasks. Instead of each car knowing how to service itself, you have a mechanic (visitor) who performs the required tasks for each car type.

The mechanic (visitor) visits the cars and applies the appropriate servicing operation.
5. Real Project Example: Tax Calculation

Imagine youâ€™re building a tax calculation system where different types of employees (e.g., salaried, contractors, freelancers) have different tax rules. Instead of embedding tax logic in each employee type, you use a visitor to calculate taxes.
