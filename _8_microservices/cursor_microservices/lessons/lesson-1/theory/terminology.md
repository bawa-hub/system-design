### 3. Service Discovery
**Definition**: Mechanism for services to find and communicate with each other in a distributed system.

**Types**:
- **Client-side discovery**: Client queries service registry
- **Server-side discovery**: Load balancer queries service registry

**Examples**: Consul, etcd, Eureka, Zookeeper

### 4. Load Balancing
**Definition**: Distributing incoming requests across multiple service instances to improve performance and availability.

**Algorithms**:
- **Round-robin**: Requests distributed in circular order

**Examples**: HAProxy, NGINX, AWS ELB, Kubernetes Service

### 5. Circuit Breaker
**Definition**: Pattern to prevent cascade failures by opening the circuit when a service is failing.

**States**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open**: Service is failing, requests are rejected immediately
- **Half-open**: Testing if service has recovered

**Examples**: Hystrix, Resilience4j, Go resilience libraries

### 6. Bulkhead Pattern
**Definition**: Isolating resources to prevent failures from spreading across the system.

**Examples**:
- Separate thread pools for different operations
- Isolated database connections
- Separate service instances for different clients

**Benefits**:

- Better resource utilization

### 7. Saga Pattern
**Definition**: Managing distributed transactions across multiple services without using traditional ACID transactions.

1. Create order
2. Reserve inventory
3. Process payment
4. Send confirmation

**Definition**: Separating read and write operations into different models.

**Benefits**:
- Independent scaling of read/write
- Different data models for different needs
- Better performance optimization
- Simplified complex domains

**Example**:
- Write model: Optimized for transactions
- Read model: Optimized for queries

### 10. Domain Events
**Definition**: Business events that occur in the domain and are published when something significant happens.

**Examples**:

**Examples**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos

### 13. Service Mesh
**Definition**: Infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication.

**Features**:
- Traffic management
- Security
- Observability
- Policy enforcement

**Examples**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect

### 14. API Versioning
**Definition**: Managing different versions of APIs to maintain backward compatibility.

**Strategies**:
- **URL versioning**: /api/v1/users
- **Header versioning**: Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1
- **Content versioning**: Different JSON schemas

### 15. Health Check
**Definition**: Endpoint that reports the health status of a service.

**Types**:
- **Liveness**: Is the service running?
- **Readiness**: Is the service ready to accept requests?

**Example**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "redis": "ok"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Data Terms

### 16. Database per Service
