D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

    "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."

🏢 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine a smartphone. It doesn’t care about the specifics of how a battery works, just that the battery has a charging interface.

    The smartphone depends on an abstraction (interface), not on the details of how different battery types work.
    You can easily swap out one battery for another (e.g., lithium-ion or solid-state) without changing the smartphone’s functionality.
