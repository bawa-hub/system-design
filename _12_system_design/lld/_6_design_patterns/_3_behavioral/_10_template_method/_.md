## Template Method Design Pattern
1. What is the Template Method Design Pattern?

The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in a method (called the template method) but allows subclasses to provide specific implementations for some of the steps of the algorithm. It lets the parent class control the flow of the algorithm, while the subclass defines the specific behavior of certain steps.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Think of a recipe for baking a cake. The overall process stays the same:

    Preheat the oven
    Mix ingredients
    Bake the cake
    Cool the cake

However, some specific details change depending on the type of cake. For example, the ingredients and baking time differ for a chocolate cake vs a vanilla cake. The recipe (template method) defines the steps, but each subclass (chocolate or vanilla cake) can change the details of how they mix or bake.
3. Why Use the Template Method Design Pattern?

    Code Reusability: Common steps are defined in the parent class, reducing code duplication.
    Control Over the Algorithm: The parent class controls the structure, ensuring consistency.
    Flexibility: Subclasses can change specific steps without altering the overall structure.

4. Analogy Example: Building a House

When you build a house, the overall process involves:

    Laying the foundation
    Building the walls
    Roofing
    Finishing (painting, installing fixtures)

However, different types of houses (e.g., wooden house vs concrete house) may require different methods for each step (e.g., materials for the walls). The construction process is the template method, and each type of house can define its specific building method.
5. Real Project Example: Order Processing

In an e-commerce system, the process of processing an order follows a template:

    Validate the order
    Process payment
    Ship the order
    Send notification

However, the payment method (e.g., credit card or PayPal) and shipping method (e.g., express or standard) will differ. Each subclass (credit card, PayPal) can define its own way of handling payments, but the overall order processing algorithm remains the same.
