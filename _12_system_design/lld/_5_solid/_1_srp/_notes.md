S â€” Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

    A class should have only one reason to change.
    In other words, a class should only do one thing, and do it well.

Why is SRP important?
        
    When a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one responsibility can unintentionally affect the others. This leads to:
    High coupling
    Low cohesion
    Difficulties in testing, maintaining, and extending code
