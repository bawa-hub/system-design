## Proxy Design Pattern
1. What is the Proxy Design Pattern?

The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. It controls access to the original object, adding an additional layer of functionality, such as security, caching, or lazy initialization.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a movie ticket counter:

    You can’t directly go to the theater hall to watch a movie.
    The ticket counter acts as a proxy, ensuring that only valid ticket holders can enter.
    This adds a layer of control while still granting you access to the movie hall.

3. Why Use the Proxy Design Pattern?

    Control Access: Restrict access to the real object.
    Add Functionality: Add pre-processing or post-processing logic, such as logging, authentication, or caching.
    Improve Performance: Lazy initialization or remote object communication.

4. Types of Proxies

    Virtual Proxy: Delays the creation of a heavy object until it’s actually needed.
    Protection Proxy: Controls access to the real object based on permissions.
    Remote Proxy: Represents an object located on a remote server.
    Caching Proxy: Caches results of expensive operations.
    Smart Proxy: Provides additional behavior, like logging or reference counting.

5. Analogy Example: ATM Machine

When you withdraw cash from an ATM, the ATM acts as a proxy for the bank account:

    It verifies your credentials.
    It retrieves your account balance.
    It ensures you can only withdraw within your balance limit.

The ATM hides the complexity of interacting directly with the bank’s database.
6. Real Project Example: API Request Proxy

In an application, a proxy can act as an intermediary between the client and an external API to:

    Handle rate limiting.
    Add caching for repeated requests.
    Include authentication tokens in requests.
