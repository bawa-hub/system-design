## Singleton Design Pattern
1. What is the Singleton Design Pattern?

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a classroom with a single whiteboard. Everyone in the room shares that one whiteboard. No matter how many students are in the classroom, there’s always just one whiteboard, and everyone refers to it.

In programming, a Singleton is like that whiteboard—it ensures only one object is created and shared across the system.

3. Why Use the Singleton Design Pattern?

    Controlled Access to Resources: Ensures a single instance for resources like database connections, configuration settings, or logging systems.
    Prevents Duplication: Guarantees there’s no unnecessary creation of multiple instances.
    Global Access: Provides a centralized and easy way to access the instance.

4. Analogy Example: The President of a Country

In a country, there is always one president at any given time. Even if different people want to reference the president, they all point to the same individual. There’s no way to create multiple presidents for the same country at the same time.

In programming, the Singleton ensures that only one "President" instance is created, no matter how many times it is referenced.

5. Real Project Example: Database Connection

In many applications, you need to manage a single connection to a database. Creating multiple connections can be resource-intensive and lead to conflicts. Using a Singleton ensures that only one connection instance exists.
