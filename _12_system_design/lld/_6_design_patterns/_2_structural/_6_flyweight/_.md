## Flyweight Design Pattern
1. What is the Flyweight Design Pattern?

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on reducing memory usage by sharing common parts of objects instead of creating new ones for every instance. It is particularly useful when working with a large number of similar objects.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a classroom of students:

    Each student has a name and a unique ID (these are unique for each student).
    But all students share a common school name and address (these are common for everyone).

Instead of storing the common data (school name and address) repeatedly for each student, you store it once and share it among all the students. This saves memory and improves efficiency.
3. Why Use the Flyweight Design Pattern?

    Minimizes Memory Usage: Reuse shared objects instead of creating duplicates.
    Improves Performance: Reduces object creation overhead, especially in scenarios with many similar objects.
    Separation of Concerns: Divides intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (unique) data for better management.

4. Analogy Example: Character Rendering in Text Editor

In a text editor:

    Every character (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c') is rendered on the screen.
    Instead of storing separate font styles, sizes, and colors for every character, the editor shares these properties across similar characters.

The editor only stores unique positions of characters while reusing shared style data.
5. Real Project Example: Gaming (Tree Rendering in a Forest)

In a 3D forest simulation:

    A game renders thousands of trees.
    Instead of storing the tree's texture and shape for each tree, the game uses a shared tree model (flyweight).
    Unique data (like position, size, and rotation) is stored for each tree individually.
