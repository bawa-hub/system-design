## Mediator Design Pattern

1. What is the Mediator Design Pattern?

The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object (the mediator) to encapsulate how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly and letting them communicate through the mediator instead.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a teacher in a classroom. Students don’t talk to each other directly; instead, they communicate through the teacher. If a student has a question, they ask the teacher, who either answers it or passes it to another student.

In programming, the mediator (teacher) manages and coordinates communication between multiple objects (students).
3. Why Use the Mediator Design Pattern?

    Simplifies Communication: Reduces the complexity of interactions between multiple objects.
    Decouples Components: Objects don’t need to know about each other; they only interact with the mediator.
    Centralized Control: Makes it easier to manage and update communication logic.

4. Analogy Example: Air Traffic Control

In an airport, planes don’t communicate with each other directly. Instead, they use an Air Traffic Controller (ATC) as a mediator.

    Planes (colleagues) send requests like landing, taking off, or changing routes to the ATC.
    The ATC (mediator) coordinates these requests to avoid collisions and ensure smooth operations.

5. Real Project Example: Chat Room

Suppose you’re building a chat room system where multiple users can send messages. Instead of users directly communicating with each other, they send messages through a ChatRoom (mediator).
