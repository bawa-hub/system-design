# How Indexes Work Internally

Indexes are stored using B-Trees (Balanced Tree) in MySQL’s default InnoDB engine.

    Each node contains keys sorted in ascending order.
    Searching follows a binary search algorithm, reducing lookups from O(n) to O(log n).
    Leaf nodes store either the actual row data (clustered index) or pointers to row data (secondary index).


# How Indexing Affects Queries
  
✅ Speeds Up Read Queries

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
    Without an index, MySQL does a full table scan (O(n)).
    With an index, MySQL performs a logarithmic search (O(log n)).

❌ Slows Down Write Operations

    INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations are slower because indexes must be updated.
    Too many indexes lead to high overhead during write-heavy operations.


📌 Best Practices for Indexing

    ✔ Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY.
    ✔ Use composite indexes for multi-column queries instead of multiple separate indexes.
    ✔ Keep indexes small by choosing the right data type (VARCHAR(20) instead of TEXT).
    ✔ Avoid over-indexing (each index consumes memory and slows inserts).
    ✔ Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans before creating indexes.

📌 Practical Examples

🛠 Creating Indexes

    CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
    CREATE INDEX idx_name_dob ON users(name, dob);

🛠 Checking Existing Indexes

    SHOW INDEX FROM users;

🛠 Removing an Index

    DROP INDEX idx_email ON users;

🛠 Analyzing Index Usage (EXPLAIN)

    EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
