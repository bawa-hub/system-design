Let's simulate query performance with large datasets and analyze how indexes impact query speed. We'll do this in three steps:

    Create a large dataset (millions of rows).
    Run queries without indexes (observe slow performance).
    Add indexes and rerun queries (see performance improvements).

Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Creating a Large Dataset

We'll create a users table and insert 1 million rows.
üîπ Create the Table

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

üîπ Insert 1 Million Random Users

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE InsertUsers()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 0;
    WHILE i < 1000000 DO
        INSERT INTO users (name, email, age)
        VALUES (
            CONCAT('User', i),
            CONCAT('user', i, '@example.com'),
            FLOOR(18 + (RAND() * 60))
        );
        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

Execute:

CALL InsertUsers();

üöÄ Now we have 1 million users! Let‚Äôs test query performance.
Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Running Queries Without Indexes

First, let's run some queries without indexes and measure execution time.
üîπ Query 1: Search by Email

SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user500000@example.com';

üí° Expected Performance:

    Without an index, MySQL will scan all 1 million rows (O(n)), making it very slow.
    Use EXPLAIN to confirm:

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user500000@example.com';

    If type = ALL, it means full table scan (bad performance).

üîπ Query 2: Get Users by Age Range

SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 30 AND 40;

üí° Expected Performance:

    No index ‚Üí full table scan (O(n)), slow on large datasets.

üîπ Query 3: Sorting Users by Name

SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 100;

üí° Expected Performance:

    Without an index, MySQL will sort all rows in memory (O(n log n)).

Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Adding Indexes and Rerunning Queries

Now, let‚Äôs add indexes and see the improvements.
üîπ Index for Fast Email Lookup

CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);

Rerun Query 1:

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user500000@example.com';

‚úÖ Expected Improvement:

    Query time drops from several seconds to milliseconds (O(log n))!

üîπ Index for Fast Age Filtering

CREATE INDEX idx_age ON users(age);

Rerun Query 2:

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 30 AND 40;

‚úÖ Expected Improvement:

    MySQL can now use the index to directly jump to age = 30 and scan forward (O(log n)).

üîπ Index for Sorting

CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);

Rerun Query 3:

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 100;

‚úÖ Expected Improvement:

    Instead of sorting 1 million rows in memory, MySQL retrieves already sorted data (O(log n)).

üöÄ Performance Gains Summary
Query Type	Without Index	With Index
Search by Email	Full table scan (O(n))	Instant lookup (O(log n)) ‚úÖ
Filter by Age	Full table scan (O(n))	Index scan (O(log n)) ‚úÖ
Sorting by Name	Sorting in memory (O(n log n))	Index scan (O(log n)) ‚úÖ
