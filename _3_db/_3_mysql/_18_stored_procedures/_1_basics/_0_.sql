-- first time you invoke a stored procedure, 
-- MySQL looks up for the name in the database catalog, 
-- compiles the stored procedureâ€™s code, 
-- place it in a memory area known as a cache, and execute the stored procedure.

-- If you invoke the same stored procedure in the same session again, 
-- MySQL just executes the stored procedure from the cache without having to recompile it.
