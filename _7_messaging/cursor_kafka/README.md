## üéì Current Lesson: Understanding Kafka Fundamentals

### What is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can:
- **Publish and subscribe** to streams of records
- **Store** streams of records in a fault-tolerant way
- **Process** streams of records as they occur

### Key Concepts:
1. **Producer** - Applications that send data
2. **Consumer** - Applications that read data
3. **Topic** - Categories for organizing messages
4. **Partition** - Topics are split into partitions for parallel processing
5. **Broker** - Kafka servers that store and serve data
6. **Consumer Group** - Multiple consumers working together

Let's start with our first hands-on example!
