# Beginner Level

    ## Introduction to Caching
        Definition and purpose of caching
        Common use cases for caching
        Benefits and limitations of caching

    ## Types of Caching
        In-memory caching
        Disk-based caching
        Distributed caching

    ## Caching Strategies
        Write-through
        Write-back
        Write-around

    ## Basic Cache Eviction Policies
        Least Recently Used (LRU)
        Least Frequently Used (LFU)
        First In, First Out (FIFO)

    ## Cache Components
        Key-value stores
        Time-to-Live (TTL)

# Intermediate Level

    ## Caching Tools and Frameworks
        Memcached
        Redis
        In-browser caching (e.g., localStorage, sessionStorage)

    ## Advanced Caching Strategies
        Cache warming
        Cache partitioning
        Cache invalidation techniques

    ## Concurrency in Caching
        Cache stampede
        Race conditions and mitigation (e.g., locking, double-checked locking)

    ## Use Cases
        Caching in web applications (e.g., API response caching)
        Caching for databases (query and result caching)
        Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

    ## Performance Metrics
        Cache hit ratio
        Latency and throughput

# Advanced Level

    ## Distributed Caching
        Architecture and design
        Consistent hashing
        Sharding

    ## Caching Patterns
        Read-through
        Refresh-ahead
        Cache-aside

    ## Scalability and Fault Tolerance
        Horizontal scaling of cache systems
        Replication
        Failover strategies

    ## Security in Caching
        Secure storage
        Data encryption in cache
        Preventing sensitive data leaks

    ## Custom Caching Implementations
        Writing your own caching layer in programming languages (e.g., Python, Java)

    ## Emerging Trends
        Hybrid caches (e.g., combining in-memory and disk-based)
        AI/ML-powered cache optimizations
