## Decorator Design Pattern
1. What is the Decorator Design Pattern?

The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add new behavior or responsibilities to objects without modifying their code. It achieves this by wrapping the object in a "decorator" object that implements the same interface.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Think of a plain burger.

    You can add extra features (like cheese, lettuce, or bacon) to the burger without changing the burger itself.
    Each topping wraps the burger, adding its own functionality.

In the end, you get a customized burger with all the desired toppings, but the original burger is still intact and unchanged.
3. Why Use the Decorator Design Pattern?

    Extend Functionality Dynamically: Add new behavior to objects at runtime without altering their structure.
    Open/Closed Principle: The object remains open for extension but closed for modification.
    Reusability: Decorators can be reused in different combinations, avoiding an explosion of subclasses.

4. Analogy Example: Coffee Shop

Imagine a coffee shop where you can order a basic coffee and add extras like milk, sugar, or whipped cream.

    Base Component: Coffee
    Decorators: Milk, sugar, whipped cream, etc.
    The coffee remains the same, but each decorator adds its own flavor (responsibility).

5. Real Project Example: Text Formatting

In a text editor, you can apply formatting like:

    Bold
    Italic
    Underline

Each formatting can be applied independently or combined. Using the decorator pattern, you can wrap text in multiple decorators to achieve the desired styling.
