# Lesson 5: Phase 1 Assessment - Foundation Mastery

## üéØ Assessment Objectives
This lesson evaluates your mastery of all Foundation Phase concepts:
- Core Kafka concepts and architecture
- Topics and partitions
- Consumer groups and parallel processing
- Replication and fault tolerance
- Practical implementation skills

## üìö Comprehensive Review

### 1. **Core Kafka Concepts Review**

#### **What is Kafka?**
- **Distributed streaming platform** for real-time data processing
- **Three main capabilities**: Publish/subscribe, store, process
- **Key characteristics**: Distributed, fault-tolerant, high-throughput, low-latency

#### **Core Architecture Components:**
- **Brokers**: Kafka servers that store and serve data
- **Topics**: Categories for organizing messages
- **Partitions**: Topics split into partitions for parallel processing
- **Producers**: Applications that send messages
- **Consumers**: Applications that read messages
- **Consumer Groups**: Teams of consumers working together

#### **Message Flow:**
```
Producer ‚Üí Topic (Partition) ‚Üí Consumer
    ‚Üì           ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  Send      Store/Order      Read/Process
```

### 2. **Topics and Partitions Review**

#### **Partitioning Strategy:**
- **Key-based partitioning**: Same key = same partition (ordering guarantee)
- **Round-robin partitioning**: No key = distributed across partitions
- **Hash function**: Determines partition assignment

#### **Partition Properties:**
- **Immutable**: Messages are appended, never modified
- **Ordered**: Messages within partition are always in order
- **Durable**: Stored on disk, not just memory
- **Replicated**: Multiple copies for fault tolerance

#### **Performance Implications:**
- **Too few partitions**: Limited parallelism, bottlenecks
- **Too many partitions**: More overhead, slower rebalancing
- **Optimal count**: Match consumer count, consider growth

### 3. **Consumer Groups Review**

#### **Consumer Group Behavior:**
- **One consumer per partition**: Each partition has only one consumer
- **Load balancing**: Work distributed across consumers
- **Fault tolerance**: Failed consumers are replaced automatically
- **Automatic rebalancing**: When consumers join/leave

#### **Rebalancing Process:**
1. **Stop**: All consumers stop processing
2. **Reassign**: Partitions are reassigned
3. **Resume**: Consumers resume with new assignments

#### **Benefits:**
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple consumers work simultaneously
- **Scalability**: Add consumers to handle more load
- **Fault tolerance**: System continues when consumers fail

### 4. **Replication and Fault Tolerance Review**

#### **Replication Concepts:**
- **Replication factor**: Number of copies of data
- **Leader**: Handles all read/write requests
- **Followers**: Replicate data from leader
- **ISR**: In-Sync Replicas that are up-to-date

#### **Fault Tolerance Levels:**
- **RF=1**: No fault tolerance (development only)
- **RF=3**: Standard fault tolerance (production)
- **RF=5**: High fault tolerance (critical systems)

#### **Leader Election:**
- **Automatic**: Happens when leader fails
- **ISR requirement**: Only ISR replicas can become leaders
- **Data safety**: Ensures no data loss during election

## üß™ Practical Assessment Exercises

### Exercise 1: Topic and Partition Management

**Objective**: Demonstrate understanding of topics and partitions

**Tasks**:
1. Create a topic with 3 partitions and replication factor 3
2. Send messages with different keys to see partitioning
3. Send messages with same key to verify ordering
4. Verify partition distribution using Kafka UI

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Topic created successfully with correct configuration
- [ ] Different keys go to different partitions
- [ ] Same key goes to same partition
- [ ] Can explain partitioning strategy

### Exercise 2: Consumer Group Implementation

**Objective**: Demonstrate consumer group understanding

**Tasks**:
1. Create a producer that sends messages to a topic
2. Start 2 consumers in the same consumer group
3. Observe partition assignment
4. Add a third consumer and observe rebalancing
5. Remove a consumer and observe rebalancing

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Consumers are assigned specific partitions
- [ ] Work is distributed between consumers
- [ ] Rebalancing occurs when consumers join/leave
- [ ] Can explain consumer group behavior

### Exercise 3: Replication and Fault Tolerance

**Objective**: Demonstrate replication understanding

**Tasks**:
1. Create a topic with replication factor 3
2. Check ISR status for all partitions
3. Send messages to the topic
4. Verify replication is working
5. Explain fault tolerance implications

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Topic created with correct replication factor
- [ ] ISR status shows all replicas in sync
- [ ] Messages are replicated to all replicas
- [ ] Can explain fault tolerance benefits
