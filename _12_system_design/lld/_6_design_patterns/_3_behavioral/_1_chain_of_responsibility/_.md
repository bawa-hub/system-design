## Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

1. What is the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern?

The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where a request is passed along a chain of handlers. 
Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine you’re in school and want permission to organize a school event. 
You ask your class teacher, who might approve it. 
If the class teacher cannot approve, they forward the request to the head teacher, and so on, until someone in the hierarchy approves or rejects the request.

In programming, this chain of teachers is like the chain of responsibility, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it along.

3. Why Use the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern?

    Decoupling: The sender of a request doesn’t need to know which handler will process it.
    Flexibility: Easily add or modify handlers in the chain without changing the code for the sender.
    Responsibility Sharing: Divide processing logic across multiple handlers, each focusing on specific tasks.

4. Analogy Example: Customer Service Escalation

If you call customer service with a problem, the process often works like this:

    The front-line agent tries to resolve your issue.
    If they can’t, the issue is escalated to a supervisor.
    If the supervisor can’t resolve it, it goes to the manager.

This is a chain of responsibility where the issue is handled by the first capable person in the chain.

5. Real Project Example: Logging System

In a logging system, you may have multiple log levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). A Chain of Responsibility can be used to handle logging based on severity.
