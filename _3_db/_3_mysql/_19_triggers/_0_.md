## a trigger is a stored program invoked automatically in response to an event such as insert, update, or delete that occurs in the associated table.

## SQL standard defines two types of triggers: row-level triggers and statement-level triggers.

A row-level trigger is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted
A statement-level trigger is executed once for each transaction regardless of how many rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

## MySQL supports only row-level triggers
