## Command Design Pattern

1. What is the Command Design Pattern?

The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize objects with different requests, delay or queue a request, and support undoable operations.

2. Explain in Simple Language

Think of a TV remote control. Each button on the remote (e.g., power on/off, volume up/down) sends a specific command to the TV. The remote doesnâ€™t know the details of how the TV works; it just sends commands.

In programming, this pattern allows you to encapsulate a command (action) as an object, separating the sender of the command from the receiver.

3. Why Use the Command Design Pattern?

    Encapsulation: Encapsulates actions into objects, making them easier to handle and manipulate.
    Flexibility: Allows you to queue, log, or undo operations without coupling the sender and receiver.
    Extensibility: You can easily add new commands without changing existing code.

4. Analogy Example: Smart Home Devices

Imagine a smart home system where you can control devices like lights, fans, and air conditioners via a voice assistant.

    The voice assistant acts as the Invoker that executes commands.
    Each device is a Receiver that performs specific actions (e.g., turning on/off).
    Commands like TurnOnLightCommand or SetTemperatureCommand encapsulate specific requests.

5. Real Project Example: Undoable Text Editor

A text editor uses the Command Pattern to encapsulate operations like typing, deleting, and formatting text. It also supports undo and redo functionality.
