The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is like a factory of factories. It provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Analogy Example: Furniture Store

Imagine you are designing a furniture store where customers can buy furniture sets for different styles, such as:
    Modern furniture set: Includes a modern chair and a modern table.
    Victorian furniture set: Includes a Victorian chair and a Victorian table.
    Art Deco furniture set: Includes an Art Deco chair and an Art Deco table.

Instead of individually picking the chair and table, the customer picks a style (Modern, Victorian, or Art Deco), and the store provides both the chair and the table in that style. The furniture store uses a factory to produce the appropriate furniture set based on the chosen style.

Key Points:

    Each furniture style (Modern, Victorian, Art Deco) is a family of products (Chair and Table).
    The Abstract Factory creates the factories for these product families.

## Why Use Abstract Factory?

    Consistency: Ensures that you always create a family of related objects (e.g., Modern Chair and Modern Table).
    Flexibility: Makes it easy to add new families of products (e.g., Scandinavian furniture or Linux UI components).
    Scalability: You only need to update the concrete factory for changes in product creation logic.
