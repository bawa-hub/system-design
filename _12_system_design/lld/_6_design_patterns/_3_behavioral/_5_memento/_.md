## Memento Design Pattern

1. What is the Memento Design Pattern?

The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to capture and restore an object's state without exposing its internal details. It allows you to save the state of an object and restore it later.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine playing a video game where you can save your progress. When you make a mistake, you can load your saved progress and continue playing.
In programming, a memento is like that save pointâ€”it captures the state of an object, so you can revert to it when needed.
3. Why Use the Memento Design Pattern?

    State Preservation: Save and restore the state of an object.
    Encapsulation: Prevent external classes from accessing and modifying the object's internal details.
    Undo/Redo Functionality: Enable actions like undo/redo in applications.

4. Analogy Example: Word Processor Save Feature

In a word processor, you can write text and save the document at any point.

    The saved state is the memento.
    If you make a mistake, you can restore the document to the saved state.

5. Real Project Example: Text Editor Undo/Redo

A text editor uses the Memento Pattern to save the state of the text at different points in time, allowing users to undo and redo changes.
