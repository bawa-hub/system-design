📌 How MySQL Stores Indexes Internally

    MySQL uses different data structures for storing indexes depending on the storage engine and index type. The two main ones are B-Trees (Balanced Trees) and Hash Indexes. Let's break them down in detail.


1️⃣ B-Trees (Used in InnoDB & MyISAM)

    MySQL’s default storage engine, InnoDB, primarily uses B+Tree indexes, a variation of B-Trees optimized for database workloads.

🔹 How B-Trees Work in Indexing

A B-Tree index stores data in a hierarchical, self-balancing tree structure to ensure efficient search, insert, and delete operations. The key properties are:

    Balanced Structure: All leaf nodes are at the same depth (ensuring O(log n) complexity).
    Sorted Order: Keys in each node are stored in ascending order.
    Multi-Level Nodes:
        Root Node → Intermediate Nodes → Leaf Nodes
        The root node points to child nodes, reducing search depth.
    Leaf Nodes Contain Pointers:
        In a clustered index, the leaf nodes store actual row data.
        In a secondary index, the leaf nodes store pointers to actual rows.

🔹 Example of a B-Tree Structure

Imagine a table indexed on a column id with values 1, 5, 10, 15, 20:

        [10]
       /    \
   [1, 5]  [15, 20]

    Searching for 15:
        Start at root (10) → move to right child (15, 20) → found! ✅
        Logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) instead of scanning all rows (O(n)).

🔹 Clustered vs. Secondary Indexes in InnoDB

    Clustered Index (Primary Key Index)
        The primary key forms the clustered index.
        The table’s actual data is stored inside the index itself in B-Tree format.
        Fast lookups but only one clustered index per table.

    Secondary Index (Non-Clustered Index)
        Stored separately from actual row data.
        Contains pointers (primary key values) to clustered index rows.
        Example:

        CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);

        Searching by email first finds the primary key, then fetches data using the clustered index.

🔹 B-Trees & Range Queries

    B-Trees are efficient for range queries (BETWEEN, ORDER BY).
    Example:

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;

        The B-Tree only needs to find the first matching leaf node and then sequentially scan forward.

2️⃣ Hash Indexes (Used in MEMORY Engine)

Unlike B-Trees, hash indexes use a key-value mapping, which makes them extremely fast for exact lookups but inefficient for range queries.

🔹 How Hash Indexes Work

    A hash function converts a key (e.g., email = 'john@example.com') into a fixed-size hash value.
    The hash value maps to a bucket containing row pointers.
    Lookup is O(1) but does not maintain order.

🔹 When to Use Hash Indexes?

    ✅ Best for exact matches (= or IN)
    ✅ Fast lookups with low memory footprint
    ❌ Not suitable for range queries (>, <, BETWEEN)

Example:

    CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    INDEX USING HASH (email)
    ) ENGINE=MEMORY;

    Searching WHERE email = 'john@example.com' is O(1).
    Searching WHERE email LIKE 'john%' is inefficient (no order maintained).

3️⃣ Full-Text Indexes (Used in InnoDB & MyISAM)

    Full-Text Indexes are optimized for text searching (MATCH ... AGAINST queries).

    Works differently from B-Trees or Hash Indexes.
    Uses inverted indexes, where each word points to a list of matching documents.

Example:

    CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_title ON articles(title, content);
    SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('database');

4️⃣ Spatial Indexes (Used in GIS Data)

Spatial Indexes (SPATIAL keyword) are used to index geographic data (POINT, POLYGON, etc.).

    Uses R-Tree structure instead of B-Trees.
    Used in Geographical Information Systems (GIS).

Example:

CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_location ON places(location);


📌 Summary
Index Type	Storage Engine	Structure	Best For	Limitations
B-Tree (Default)	InnoDB, MyISAM	Balanced Tree (Hierarchical)	Most queries (WHERE, ORDER BY, BETWEEN)	Slower for exact matches than Hash Index
Hash Index	MEMORY	Key-Value Mapping	Exact lookups (WHERE col = X)	No range queries (<, >, ORDER BY ineffective)
Full-Text Index	InnoDB, MyISAM	Inverted Index	Searching words in text columns	Cannot be used for exact matches (=)
Spatial Index	InnoDB, MyISAM	R-Tree	Geographic (GIS) data	Requires special data types (POINT, POLYGON)
