## Strategy Design Pattern

1. What is the Strategy Design Pattern?

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms or strategies, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable at runtime. It enables the selection of an algorithm independently of the client that uses it.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine you are traveling and need to decide how to get to your destination. You can choose between multiple strategies, like walking, driving, or taking a train.

    The travel method (e.g., walking, driving) is the strategy.
    You can switch between strategies depending on the situation, such as time, cost, or distance.

3. Why Use the Strategy Design Pattern?

    Flexibility: Allows you to choose an algorithm at runtime.
    Open/Closed Principle: Easily add new strategies without modifying existing code.
    Code Reusability: Encapsulates algorithmic behaviors, making them reusable across different contexts.

4. Analogy Example: Payment Methods

When shopping online, you can pay using different methods such as a credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer.

    The payment methods are the strategies.
    The shopping app selects the appropriate payment strategy based on user choice.

5. Real Project Example: Sorting Algorithms

In an application, you might need to sort data using different strategies, like quick sort, merge sort, or bubble sort, based on the size and nature of the data.
