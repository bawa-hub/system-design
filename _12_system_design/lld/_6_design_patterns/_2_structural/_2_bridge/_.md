## Bridge Design Pattern
1. What is the Bridge Design Pattern?

The Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It decouples the high-level abstraction from low-level details, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a remote control that operates various devices, such as a TV, radio, or sound system.

    The remote control is the abstraction (it provides a high-level interface like "turn on" or "adjust volume").
    The devices (TV, radio, sound system) are the implementation (they perform the actual actions).

By separating the remote control from the devices, you can extend or change either independently. For example:

    Add a new remote control type (e.g., voice-controlled remote).
    Add a new device type (e.g., projector).

3. Why Use the Bridge Design Pattern?

    Flexibility: Both abstraction and implementation can be developed and extended independently.
    Reduces Complexity: Avoids having a large hierarchy of tightly coupled classes.
    Open/Closed Principle: Easily add new abstractions or implementations without modifying existing code.

4. Analogy Example: Payment System

Consider a payment system where:

    The payment type (Online Payment, Offline Payment) is the abstraction.
    The payment provider (PayPal, Stripe, Square) is the implementation.

By using the bridge pattern:

    You can create new payment types (e.g., recurring payment) without modifying the payment provider logic.
    You can add new payment providers (e.g., Razorpay) without modifying the payment types.

5. Real Project Example: Shape and Colors

In a graphics library, you have shapes (Circle, Square) and colors (Red, Blue).

    Shape is the abstraction.
    Color is the implementation.

Using the Bridge Pattern, you can draw different combinations of shapes and colors without creating a class for every combination (e.g., RedCircle, BlueCircle, etc.).##
