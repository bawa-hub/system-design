## What is the Factory Method Design Pattern?

The Factory Method Design Pattern is like hiring a specialized chef in a restaurant to make dishes based on the type of cuisine. 
Unlike the Simple Factory, where a single factory creates all the objects, in the Factory Method, each type of object has its own dedicated factory.

Key Difference:
    Simple Factory: One factory creates everything.
    Factory Method: Each type of object has its own factory.


## Real-Life Analogy: Restaurant Chefs

Imagine a restaurant where:
    You want Italian food, so you ask the Italian chef to cook pasta.
    You want Chinese food, so you ask the Chinese chef to cook noodles.
    You want Indian food, so you ask the Indian chef to cook curry.

In this case:
    The Italian Chef, Chinese Chef, and Indian Chef are factories.
    Each chef specializes in making their own type of dish.

## Why Use the Factory Method Pattern in Real Projects?

1. Flexibility: Add new database types easily (e.g., MongoDB) by creating a new factory.
2. Separation of Concerns: Each database has its own factory, keeping the connection logic separate.
3. Scalability: If the connection logic changes for a specific database, you only update its factory.
