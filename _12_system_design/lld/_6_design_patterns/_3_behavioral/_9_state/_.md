## State Design Pattern

1. What is the State Design Pattern?

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class, enabling it to act differently depending on its state.
2. Explain in Simple Language

Imagine a traffic light. The behavior of the light changes depending on its state:

    When it's in the Red state, cars stop.
    When it's in the Green state, cars go.
    When it's in the Yellow state, cars prepare to stop.

The traffic light (object) doesn't know which state it is in, but based on the current state, it behaves differently. The state can change, and the object adapts accordingly.
3. Why Use the State Design Pattern?

    Simplifies code: Avoids complex conditionals (e.g., if statements) in the object.
    State-specific behavior: Behaviors change automatically based on state, without explicit code changes.
    Open/Closed Principle: Adding new states doesn’t require changes to existing code.

4. Analogy Example: Elevator

Think of an elevator with multiple states like:

    Idle: The elevator waits for the user to press a button.
    Moving Up: The elevator moves to the upper floor.
    Moving Down: The elevator moves to the lower floor.
    Door Open: The doors are open, waiting for passengers.

Each state defines a specific behavior for the elevator, and when the state changes (e.g., from Idle to Moving Up), the elevator’s behavior changes automatically.
5. Real Project Example: Order Processing System

In an order processing system, an order can be in different states like:

    Pending: The order has been placed but not processed yet.
    Shipped: The order has been shipped.
    Delivered: The order has been delivered.
    Canceled: The order has been canceled.

The system can change the behavior of the order based on its state.
